1,Acicular,"The fragile, needle-like habit of some mineral crystals.",,
2,Adamantine,"Very bright luster, typically found in transparent minerals.",,
3,Allochromatism, A range of colours in minerals caused by the presence of foreign elements.,,
4,Arborescent," The treelike habit of some mineral crystals, with branches spreading in one or more directions.",,
5,Conchoidal," A type of fracture resulting in smoothly curved concentric rings around the stress point, generating a shell-like appearance. Quartz is an example of a mineral with conchoidal fracture. ",,
6,Cleavage," A plane of structural weakness at the atomic level, along which a mineral is likely to split smoothly.",,
7,Crystal habit," The favoured growth pattern of the crystal of a mineral, both individually and in aggregate.",,
8,Fracture, The non-directional characteristic mark left when a mineral chips or breaks.,,
9,Gangue, Commercially worthless rock surrounding or closely mixed with an economically important mineral in an ore deposit.,,
10,Granite," A common type of intrusive felsic igneous rock with a medium to course-grained texture, comprising quartz, plagioclase feldspar and alkali feldspar.",,
11,Hackly," A fractured surface with multiple small, sharp, jagged irregularities.",,
12,Hydrothermal, Pertains to the circulation of hot aqueous fluids or gases within Earth's crust.,,
13,Idiochromatic, Refers to a mineral color derived directly from the presence of one or more elements.,,
14,Iridescence, A rainbow of colors caused by the interference of light in thin films of different refractive indices and varying thicknesses.,,
15,Luster," Thee overall sheen of a mineral, caused by the quantity and quality of light reflected from its exterior surface.",,
16,Malleable, Describes a mineral that can easily be hammered into thin sheets.,,
17,Metallic, A mineral luster that is opaque and very reflective because of a high absorptive index.,,
18,Non-metallic, A type of luster that causes a mineral to look not at all like a metal.,,
19,Opalescence, An opal-like play of light in which reflections off the mineral produce flashes of different colors.,,
20,Pegmatite, A coarse-grained igneous rock with interlocking grains of about 2.5 cm or larger.,,
21,Pelitic,Describes sedimentary rock composed of fine fragments such as clay or mud.,,
22,Rhyolite," An extrusive igneous rock of felsic composition typically comprised of quartz, alkali feldspar and plagioclase. It can have a variety of textures and ranges from fine- to coarse-grained, depending on its cooling rate.",,
23,Sectile, Describes a mineral that can easily be cut with a knife.,,
24,Space group," In crystallography, describes the symmetry of the crystal; can be one of 230 types.",,
25,Streak, The color of the powder left after a mineral has been rubbed across unglazed porcelain.,,
26,Striation, Shallow parallel grooves or lines along flat crystal faces.,,
27,Subconchoidal," A type of mineral fracture that falls somewhere between conchoidal and even; the broken surface is smooth, with irregularly rounded corners.",,
28,Submetallic," A luster that has the look of a metal dulled by weathering or corrosion, typically on opaque minerals.",,
29,Tenacity," A mineral's resistance to breaking, bending or otherwise being deformed.",,
30,Tri-State Mining District," A historic mining district in southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. It is one of the major lead and zinc mining areas in the world and has produced a variety of exemplary mineral specimens.",,
